**Description

The first module of “AwareME” platform focuses on health awareness, specifically on dengue threat. We have identified three main stages for dengue awareness: (1) awareness on preventing dengue fever, (2) awareness on responding when suffering from dengue fever and (3) awareness on speedy recovering from dengue fever . We have developed a puzzle game to improve thinking ability and recalling ability and, a 3D Action game to improve the decision-making ability for above mentioned awareness stages.
