Health Awareness - 2D Puzzle Kids Game

Description
The first module of “AwareME” platform focuses on health awareness, specifically on dengue threat. We have identified three main stages for dengue awareness: (1) awareness on preventing dengue fever, (2) awareness on responding when suffering from dengue fever and (3) awareness on speedy recovering from dengue fever . We have developed a puzzle game to improve thinking ability and recalling ability and, a 3D Action game to improve the decision-making ability for above mentioned awareness stages.

The puzzle game has five levels and levels are categorized into three parts as thinking, memorizing, and summarizing. As shown in Figure 2, a standard puzzle is given to think and solve at a given time, targeting to improve the thinking ability. After the successful completion of puzzles, a tag with specific actions required for previously mentioned dengue awareness stages is shown, to read and memorize. Finally, for the summarizing, players are required to identify the correct summary, which describes the specific actions required for corresponding dengue awareness stage.
